SS7 Hack
All that can happen because of a gap in the Signaling SS7 protocol (Signaling System 7), 
which is a set of protocol signals that are used to regulate and undermine the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). 
It can also translate portability of telephone numbers, prepaid billing, short messages (SMS), and other services.

This technique is popular since many applications use two-step verification.
